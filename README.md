# Getting and Cleaning Data Final Course Project

This repository contains the final submission of Getting and Cleaning Data course project.

The folder "UCI HAR Dataset" is created after running run_analysis.R and the tidy set is stored in that directory as well. I have included smartphoneAverages.txt in this repository for reference purposes only.

The files included in this repository are as follows:
* run_analysis.R : turns raw data into tidy and outputs the file "smartphoneAverages.txt"
* smartphoneAverages.txt : the final tidy data set
* Codebook.md : contains information of the variables used and the steps taken in running the analysis
* README.md : describes the files in the repository
